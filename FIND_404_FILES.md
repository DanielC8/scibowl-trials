# 🔍 Finding Which Files Are 404

## Do This Now:

1. Keep Developer Tools open (F12)
2. Click the **"Network"** tab (next to Console)
3. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. Look for items highlighted in **RED**
5. Click on the RED items
6. Tell me the **Name** column of each red item

## What I Need:

The exact filenames that are failing, like:
- `index-xxx.js` 
- `index-xxx.css`
- etc.

And the **full URL** it's trying to load from (shown when you click the red item).

---

## Quick Check:

In the Network tab, do you see files like:
- `/assets/index-xxx.js` (starting with `/assets/`)
- OR
- `/scibowl-trials/assets/index-xxx.js` (starting with `/scibowl-trials/`)

Tell me which one you see!
